title: "Welcome to First Step Labs"
date: 07-07-2025


After weeks of thinking about it, which for me is a lifetime, here it is.. my first blog post. I have no idea how far I will go with this yet, but I am spending so much time learning about this I feel compelled to share my thoughts and experiences. To help and inpsire others, and to also inspire others to help me along this path. There is so much to learn and I feel like I want to do so much, but I am hoping this will help me focus on my thoughts as I try to share what I am working on and capture my thoughts. 

My goals this year are to complete my Network+ and Security+ to get a solid foundation in the Cybersecurity field. That's the boring stuff, but it helps me to have milestones along the path. What's fun to me is experimenting and learning more. This was not something I anticipated enjoying so much, but I can sit and try new labs and learn new skills all day. If you are interested in learning follow along!
